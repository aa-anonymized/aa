/**
 * Java Runnable implementation to handle calls to Mace4, which runs as a separate application in a separate process.
 * 
 * Mace4 checks for counterexample model at the same time that Prover9 looks for proofs. 
 *
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *  Mace4 return values: (from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/AR/mace4/July-2005/doc/mace4.pdf)
 *  
 *  0:  The specified number of models (max models, default 1) was found.<p>
 *  1:  fatal error <p>
 *  2:  The search completed without finding any models. <p>
 *  3:  Some models were found, but the search completed before maxmodels models were found.<p>
 *  4:  Some models were found, but the time limit (maxseconds, default âˆž) terminated the search before maxmodels models were found.<p>
 *  5:  The time limit (max seconds) terminated the search before any models were found.
